- try different learning rates
- try adding more layers
- try increasing breadth (add hidden layer)
- try convolutional layer

- look into scheduler, optimizer
    - figure out if LR is decaying too fast

== 

- train modelv23
- do some reading online about training in general like before
- look again at validation code, what is test vs validation
- maybe try one model with absurd number of parameters
- look into moliere scattering
